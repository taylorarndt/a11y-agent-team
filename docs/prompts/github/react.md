# react

Add an emoji reaction to a GitHub issue, pull request, or specific comment using natural language.

## When to Use It

- Acknowledging an issue report without posting a comment
- Upvoting a feature request or important PR
- Adding thumbs-up to a specific comment without cluttering the thread
- Expressing sentiment on a discussion post

## How to Launch It

**In GitHub Copilot Chat:**
```
/react owner/repo#89 👍
```

Or with natural language:
```
/react owner/repo#89 thumbs up
/react owner/repo#89 I love this idea
/react owner/repo#89 heart the latest comment
```

## What to Expect

1. **Parse intent** — Identifies reaction type from emoji, name, or natural language
2. **Identify target** — Issue/PR or specific comment (latest or by number)
3. **Preview** — Shows which item will receive the reaction
4. **Add reaction** — Posts via GitHub API immediately (reactions are non-destructive)

### Natural Language to Reaction Mapping

| You say | Reaction added |
|---------|----------------|
| thumbs up / +1 / great / agree / 👍 | 👍 +1 |
| thumbs down / -1 / disagree / 👎 | 👎 -1 |
| laugh / funny / lol / 😄 | 😄 laugh |
| hooray / celebrate / party / 🎉 | 🎉 hooray |
| confused / not sure / 😕 | 😕 confused |
| heart / love / ❤️ | ❤️ heart |
| rocket / let's go / 🚀 | 🚀 rocket |
| eyes / watching / looking / 👀 | 👀 eyes |

### Target Selection

| You say | Where the reaction goes |
|---------|------------------------|
| (nothing) | The issue/PR itself |
| `latest comment` | The most recent comment |
| `@alice's comment` | The most recent comment by alice |
| `comment #3` | The third comment in the thread |

### Sample Flow

```
You: /react owner/repo#89 heart the latest comment
